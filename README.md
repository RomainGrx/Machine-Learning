# Training Reinforcement Learning

Quality Learning (Q-Learning)
===============
You can train the model by running the program

You have access to the Colab version in the [Q Learning/README](https://github.com/RomainGrx/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Q%20Learning/README.md)

Deep Quality Networks (DQN)
===============
You can train the model by running the program

3 types of agents:
- Deep quality network 
- Double deep quality network
- Prioritized memory DQN
